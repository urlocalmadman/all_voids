# all_voids

Combinations of all possible emotions along with their levels with all possible vivid types and normal type.
Also has a collection of the svgs of all the voidpets so that you can edit and view them in higher resolution easier.
Now it _also_ has all the animations and each individual frame.

I don't own any of the designs here and they've all been scraped from https://voidpet.com/o/pet-item-editor. All the designs belong to the creators Ben Awad and Linda Shad.

To render the svgs, I recommend using a website like https://mybyways.com/blog/convert-svg-to-png-using-your-browser. Just paste the html in the input box way down. Left it in this way as I found it easier to edit and understand.

### Updates

-   Added `Cringe` sprites

### Previously

-   All sprites are now transparent and 150% bigger
-   `main.py` is deprecated
-   Sprites no longer rely on https://img.voidpet.com
-   Added `all.js` to convert svgs to pngs. Changed `svg.js` to `one.js` cus it sounds cooler and more accurate
