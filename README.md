# all_voids

Combinations of all possible emotions along with their levels with all possible vivid types and normal type.
Also has a collection of the svgs of all the voidpets so that you can edit and view them in higher resolution easier.
Now it *also* has all the animations and each individual frame.

I don't own any of the designs here and they've all been scraped from https://img.voidpet.com and https://voidpet.com/o/pet-item-editor. All the designs belong to the creators Ben Awad and Linda Shad.

To render the svgs, I recommend using a website like https://mybyways.com/blog/convert-svg-to-png-using-your-browser. Just paste the html in the input box way down. Left it in this way as I found it easier to edit and understand.
