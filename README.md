Combinations of all possible emotions along with their levels with all possible vivid types and normal type.
Also has a collection of the svgs of all the voidpets so that you can edit and view them in higher resolution easier

I don't own any of the designs here and they've all been scraped from https://img.voidpet.com and https://voidpet.com/o/pet-item-editor. All the designs belong to the creators Ben Awad and Linda Shad.
