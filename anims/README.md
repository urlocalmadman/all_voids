# Animations only

In voidpet, some attacks use the same animation as pre-existing attacks. For this reason you will not find the **names** of all the attacks but you definitely will find all the animations.

All frames are transparent but GIFs have a black background. This is because of .gif format's inability to support partial transparency(think glowing effects etc) so to retain those effect, a black background is the best solution.

All animations were taken from [this subdomain](https://img.voidpet.com/anim). I don't own any of the images. They are created and owned by Linda Shad and Ben Awad, the creator of [voidpet](https://voidpet.com).
